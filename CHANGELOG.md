## [1.1.3] - 2026-06-28

### Fixed

- Android ANR after connect/disconnect — Xray shutdown no longer blocks the UI thread
- Android VPN service now calls `StartForeground` when started (required on Android 8+)
- VPN teardown stops the service and closes the TUN interface on disconnect

### Changed

- Faster connect — core readiness detected via SOCKS port probe instead of a fixed delay
- Android startup pre-extracts geo assets in the background
- Server list and settings load in parallel on app launch

## [1.1.2] - 2026-06-27

### Added

- Real proxy latency test (HTTP via local SOCKS, like v2rayN Real ping)
- Subscription URL saved in settings with **Refresh** to re-fetch servers
- Android clipboard support for **Paste** import
- FAQ index (`docs/faq/README.md`) replacing placeholder stub pages

### Fixed

- Android connect failure on Android 10+ — Xray shipped as `libxray.so` in native libs (SELinux)
- Import text box clears automatically after a successful **Add** / **Paste**

### Changed

- Latency docs and subscription docs updated

## [1.1.1] - 2026-06-27

### Fixed

- Connect crash on Windows ("different thread owns this object") — Xray process events now marshal to the UI thread
- Clear error when local ports 10808/10809 are in use (e.g. v2rayN already running)
- Windows release packages ship as `v2rayF.exe` instead of `v2rayF.Desktop.exe`
